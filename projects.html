          <h2>Latest Projects</h2>
		    <p>By achieving Living Building Certification, Petal Certification and Net Zero Energy Building Certification, these projects demonstrated that buildings can improve the ecosystems they inhabit. Our gallery of case studies details each project's journey from inspired vision to inspirational development.</p>

			  <h3>Smith College Bechtel Environmental Classroom</h3>
			  <p>Smith College's Bechtel Environmental Classroom in Whately, Massachusetts is a new, 2,500 S.F. single-story wood-framed classroom building, acting as a field station for a 233-acre forest and pasture property. For the past 60 years the property has accommodated an astronomical observatory. Recently, Smith College declared its intention to open the pastoral setting to class activity, enriching a wide range of Smith’s courses with natural inspiration — everything from the biological and earth sciences to architecture, poetry and dance courses.</p>

			  <h3>Bertschi Living Building Science Wing</h3>
			  <p>Bertschi School Living Science Building, located in Seattle’s Capitol Hill Neighborhood, was one of the first projects in the world to pursue the Living Building Challenge v2.0 criteria and the first to achieve it. This non-profit elementary school science wing was collaboratively designed with the students' input and pro-bono by the entire design team. A 20-kilowatt PV system produces all of the electricity for the building and allows students to participate in real-time monitoring of the building’s energy use and solar power production. All the water needed for the building is collected and treated on site.</p>
